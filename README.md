# EMPATH: MediaPipe-aided Ensemble Learning with Attention-based Transformers for Accurate Recognition of Bangla Word-Level Sign Language

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for EMPATH, a cutting-edge framework designed to significantly enhance the recognition of Bangla Word-Level Sign Language (BdSL). EMPATH integrates the robust capabilities of MediaPipe Holistic for landmark detection and tracking with the power of ensemble learning and attention-based Transformer models to set new benchmarks in sign language recognition accuracy.

## Overview

EMPATH is designed to address the challenges in accurately recognizing isolated sign language by leveraging a synergistic approach that combines advanced machine learning techniques. It showcases exceptional performance across various datasets, including BdSL-40, BDSign-Word, INCLUDE, WLASL, and MSL Medical Dataset demonstrating its adaptability to diverse linguistic contexts. Furthermore, EMPATH employs a specialized regression model to effectively handle missing keypoints, showcasing its robust capabilities and identifying areas for enhancement.
